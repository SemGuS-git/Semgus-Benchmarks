# Messy Benchmarks

There are 2 sorts of benchmarks in each category. The first, under "correct_input_output", are the synthesis queries one would expect from the filename. The second, under "inverted_input_output", are the same queries with inputs and outputs reversed (i.e., we take inputs as outputs and vice versa.)
