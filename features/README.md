= Feature Benchmarks =
The SemGuS feature benchmarks are designed to be trivially solvable if a solver supports a particular feature
that may be present in a benchmark. This gives a gauge on how broad a particular solver is on different domains
and types of problems. Features can correspond to SMT theories, specification types, CHC constructions, and more.

The benchmarks are named `feature_<name>_<number>_<description>.sem`.
