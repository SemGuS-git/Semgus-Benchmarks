This repository contains benchmark files for Semgus.

Note: the `semgus-cli.sh` shortcut assumes that this repo is situated as a submodule of [SemGuS-Interpreter](https://github.com/Semgus-git/Semgus-Interpreter) and that a .Net 5.0 debug build has been made.

This may be less performant than a release build!
