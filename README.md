# Semantics-Guided Synthesis Benchmarks

This repository contains benchmark files for [Semgus](https://semgus.org).

Files with the `.sem` extension may be used with both the [Messy](https://github.com/kjw227/Messy-Release) and [Bless](https://github.com/SemGuS-git/Bless-Release) solvers; see their respective repositories for further documentation. The `.toml` files in this repository specify task configurations for Bless.

## Benchmark Contributions
Contributions of new benchmarks are welcome. Open a PR adding the benchmarks, and a maintainer will review the submission.
* Benchmarks must be categorized into appropriate folders. If an appropriate folder does not exist, feel free to create it.
* All contributed benchmarks must pass a syntax check before being approved, based on the current release of the [SemGuS Parser](https://github.com/SemGuS-git/Semgus-Parser).
* Feel free to create discussion posts with any questions, or issues about potential bugs in existing benchmarks.
